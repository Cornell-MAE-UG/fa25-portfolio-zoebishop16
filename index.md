## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}. As a fourth-year student in the College of Engineering at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my academic knowledge and technical skills in a professional environment. I believe that my strong foundation in engineering principles, combined with my innovative problem-solving, makes me a valuable candidate for an internship.

Throughout my time at Cornell, I have gained hands-on experience with projects that have sharpened my skills in design, analysis, and mechanical systems. In addition, my coursework has equipped me with proficiency in AutoCAD software, Fusion360, MATLAB, Python, and materials. My strong work ethic, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively on team projects have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to an engineering team.
