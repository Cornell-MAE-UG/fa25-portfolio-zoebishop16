    The Boeing 737 Max case involves two fatal crashes that were caused by faulty MCAS software. The decisions by FAA and Boeing raise many ethical concerns. The ethical actions taken seriously impacted the lives of others both directly and indirectly. Five issues that are critically important to the Boeing 737 Max case include the waiving of the angle of attack (AOA) test results, the FAA outsourcing Boeing inspectors to Boeing, ignoring the pilots’ testing feedback, the MCAS not included in the manual, and the decision-making process behind grounding a plane.
    Should Boeing have been able to waive the AOA test results? This issue is critical to the case because Boeing knew that the results showed fault and did not address the issue. A missing fact from the issue is that we do not know how issues or concerns were communicated between different departments. Due to executives and engineers being located in two different states, we can assume there was a lack of communication. In the outcomes, we see a lack of oversight. Boeing actively ignored the test results, which held safety secondary to timeline and money. Boeing should have replaced all known faulty sensors and addressed the results to prioritize safety.
    Should the FAA have outsourced Boeing inspectors to Boeing? Outsourcing Boeing inspectors to Boeing leads to bias in regulating the design, and bias can become a safety issue if the design is not critically analyzed. This decision puts passengers’, pilots’, and flight attendants’ lives at risk. There were faulty test results that were overlooked. They were aware of the faulty test results, and they are outsourcing because of limited resources and time constraints. This indicated the pushing of a personal agenda due to biases and market pressure. Achieving a non-personal agenda is critical because, with unbiasedness, safety is more likely to be upheld. In addition, Boeing engineers should not be expected to regulate because it is not their area of expertise. The FAA should have performed the inspections independently rather than outsourcing to Boeing in order to reduce bias.
    Should Boeing have ignored the pilots' testing feedback? Pilots are the direct users of the plane, so if they identify an issue, it should be investigated. A lapse in addressing the issue creates a safety concern and allows problems to go unaddressed. Pilots reported the same issue that ultimately caused the plane to crash, and there is email evidence of Boeing neglecting pilot feedback. Boeing chose to ignore this feedback due to timeline constraints and market pressure. This demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of the primary users. Boeing should have respected the pilots because they are experts in operating the aircraft, not Boeing personnel. Boeing did not avoid the conflict of interest created by ignoring results in order to release the plane and generate revenue more quickly. Boeing should have listened to pilots and investigated their feedback more thoroughly.
    Should Boeing have excluded MCAS from the manual? If pilots had been trained on the MCAS software, they may have been able to identify system issues and avoid the crashes. The decision not to include MCAS in the manual directly impacted the safety of everyone on board the aircraft. Additionally, pilots were not provided with all the necessary information to fly the plane safely. An important missing piece is the reason Boeing de-emphasized the importance of MCAS. It can be assumed that including it in the manual would have required additional time, money, and training. However, even with this missing information, the lack of pilot training meant Boeing failed to ensure safety. There was also a conflict of interest driven by market pressure, which resulted in incomplete information being provided in the manual. MCAS should have been included in the manual to uphold public safety and welfare.
    Who is responsible for grounding a plane, and when should that occur? Boeing and the FAA did not ground the plane after the first crash. Boeing released a statement assuring the public of the aircraft’s safety; however, a second crash occurred afterward. They were aware of an issue, and the second crash could potentially have been avoided. A missing fact from this issue is whether engineers or managers were incentivized to accelerate the process. This may have been influenced by a culture that prioritized profit over safety and adherence to schedules. Boeing did not want to risk public trust in its aircraft and therefore delayed grounding the plane. This decision shows that Boeing prioritized its brand and company image over safety. In addition, Boeing and the FAA spoke on technical issues outside their expertise, and the FAA failed to act as a faithful agent for the public. Public statements were not thorough or fully truthful. Boeing should have grounded the 737 Max aircraft and conducted a comprehensive investigation.
    In conclusion, the Boeing 737 Max case is a prime example of a failure to uphold fundamental engineering ethics. The driving forces behind Boeing’s decisions were time, money, and market competitiveness. This lapse in ethical decision-making resulted in public safety not being prioritized. Ethical engineering requires strong relationships between engineers, airlines, regulators, and stakeholders. It also demands transparency and trust, ensuring that safety and innovation are prioritized over financial gain.
