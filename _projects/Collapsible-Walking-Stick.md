## Project Overview

For a mechanical synthesis course, we were tasked to work in a team of five on an open design project. My team collectively decided to develop a walking stick that supports the weight of the average man/woman and serves as a user-friendly, transportable tool for those either hiking or struggling with mobility. We created an extended structure to be robust enough to withstand a load of up to 300 lbs. The stick also collapsed to fit comfortably in a hand or tote bag. Components of the prototype included a folding handle on a hinge, collapsible stages that function with a spring pin locking mechanism, and a variety of possible stage heights to meet the intersection between adjustability and compatibility.

## My Contributions

- Brainstormed potential designs by creating detailed sketches.
- Completed the Bill of Materials chart, which documented all RPL and McMaster parts used in the prototype.
- Assisted with CAD renderings.
- Attached the handle to the prototype.
- Contributed to the final technical report.
