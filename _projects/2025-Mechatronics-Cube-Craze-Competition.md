## Project Overview

Worked in a team of three to design, prototype, build, and program an Arduino-based robot for a Mechatronics Cube Craze competition. The goal of the competition was to design a robot that would gather more cubes randomly scattered in a 16 square foot arena than a competitor robot in a one-minute period. The robot must meet an 8×8-inch starting cube constraint, but can expand in size once competition has begun.

## My Contributions

- Helped create potential robot designs, and then combined ideas to optimize stability and speed while remaining on budget. 
- Wrote the Arduino code in C for timed arm deployment and autonomous navigation.
- Led iterative testing to improve reliability. 
- Contributed to the final technical report analyzing design decisions and competition performance.

## Results

- Of the 45 teams that entered, our team finished in 2nd place.
- The robot successfully deployed its arms and collected blocks.
