#### Project Overview:
For Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, we were tasked to work in a team of four to design
the blades of a small-scale wind turbine. The blades had to meet a maximum length of 6 inches and be compatible with a standard hub piece. The wind turbine had to be designed to operate at a fixed angular velocity determined by the team and used in an environment where the wind follows a velocity distribution described by a Weibull probability distribution.

#### My contributions:
•	Assisted with Fusion 360 CAD renderings
•	Wrote the preliminary experimental protocol for blade testing.
•	Wrote MATLAB code to analyze the results of our blade testing.
•	Created a presentation with my fellow team members to describe our blade design and findings.
•	Contributed to the final technical report.
