## Project Overview

For the Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, our team of four designed blades for a small-scale wind turbine. The blades were constrained to a maximum length of 6 inches and required compatibility with a standard hub assembly. The turbine was designed to operate at a fixed angular velocity selected by the team and evaluated under wind conditions modeled using a Weibull velocity distribution.

## Design Process

The blade geometry was developed using Autodesk Fusion 360. Aerodynamic considerations informed airfoil selection, spanwise taper, and overall blade profile to maximize efficiency while maintaining structural integrity at the hub.

MATLAB was used to automate aerodynamic calculations and guide the placement of cross-sections along the blade span. These outputs directly informed the CAD geometry.

## Testing Summary

Experimental testing was conducted in a wind tunnel to generate power curves across a range of wind speeds. Torque was incrementally applied until stall conditions were reached, allowing power output and efficiency to be evaluated as a function of tip speed ratio.
