## Project Overview

As a member of the Engineers in Action team at Cornell, I served as the Quality Control Engineer on the Summer 2024 build of an 88-meter suspended pedestrian footbridge in Eswatini, Africa. This suspended footbridge connects the Dvokolwako and Zondondo royal kraals and spans over the Black Mbuluzi River. With the installation of this bridge, over 5,000 people now have safer access to medical care, education, markets, and work without the risk of high-water levels.

## My Contributions

- Prior to traveling to Eswatini, worked with the engineering subteam using AutoCAD and a survey tool to generate a bridge model and prepare for building the footbridge.
- Assisted with the write-up and design-for-review calls of the bridge.
- On the construction site, actively monitored bridge build quality and audited and recorded as-built details. 
- Communicated with the project manager, bridge engineer, community members, masons, and engineering team back in the United States.
