## Project Overview

For the Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, our team of four designed blades for a small-scale wind turbine. The blades were constrained to a maximum length of 6 inches and horizontal width of 2 inches and required compatibility with a standard hub assembly. The turbine was designed to operate at a fixed angular velocity selected by the team and evaluated under wind conditions modeled using a Weibull velocity distribution.

## Design Process

The blade design was a blend between two airfoils. We chose to combine NACA 4412 at the root, and NACA 6409 near the tip to optimize the lift-to-drag ratio. The NACA 4412 airfoil has a high flexural strength and ensured that the blade was strong enough to withstand any bending moment produced by drag forces near the hub. The 6409 airfoil with its high lift-to-drag ratio at higher Reynolds numbers was a good choice for the blade’s tip, since this is where the blade will be moving the fastest and a smaller surface area will help reduce drag. Additionally, the pitch angle was adjusted to ensure an ideal angle of attack across the length of the blade. 

We wrote a MATLAB script to calculate the optimal blade element specifications and generated nine cross-sections’ locations (three NACA 4412, six NACA 6409). The cross sections were connected the sweep function in Autodesk Fusion 360. Additionally, we adjusted the sketches rotation to change angle of attack across the length of the blade and incorporate twist. These values were also from our MATLAB code.

## Testing Summary

To assess the actual performance of our design, the blades were tested at various wind speeds in the wind tunnel to create power curves and perform a performance analysis. Testing was conducted across six different wind speeds ranging from 2.9 to 5.8 meters per second. Power curves were generated by incrementally applying torque until the blades stall. The force from the torque break-imposed torque on the shaft and was incremented until the turbine stopped spinning. 

For the performance analysis we used the testing data to compare the power coefficient to the tip speed ratio. The results showed that the maximum tip speed ratio corresponds to the maximum power coefficient. Using the peak of the power curve that corresponded to the maximum power coefficient and tip speed ratio wind speed, we found the RPM corresponding to the maximum power output. The optimal angular velocity for our blade was 1360.83 RPM.
