## Project Overview

Designed a load cell using a ring geometry with strain gauges on the inner and outer edges of the ring at two locations. The design goal was to maximize the voltage output of the load cell (mV/V) at the rated load. The design was required to attain at least 3 mV/V output at the rate load of 200 lbf. In a team of two, completed a technical report that included hand calculations, material and dimension information, a CAD model, and FEM Analysis in ANSYS.
